The Russian people — already hostile to the German-born Tsarina — learned of the new heir’s debilitating condition and blamed the Tsarina for the boy’s affliction, causing the Tsarina considerable mental and emotional distress for the rest of her life.</p><p>Unable to find doctors who could cure her son’s condition, or even allieviate his symptoms, the Tsarina put her faith in Rasputin when he stepped forward and promised that he could treat the sickly child’s symptoms through prayer and faith-healing. </p><p>To this day, no one knows what Rasputin did to treat Alexei. Whether it was folk medicine, magic, or some sort of placebo effect, it appeared to work. While Alexei’s condition wasn’t cured, Rasputin — and only Rasputin — was able to moderate the boy’s symptoms.</p><p>Rasputin’s ability to treat Alexei’s hemophilia made him indispenseable to the Romanovs and Rasputin knew it, exploiting his position to gain greater control over them.</p><h2>Anxiety Grows Among Russia’s Aristocracy</h2><p><span>Wikimedia Commons</span><span>A political cartoon mocking Grigori Rasputin and his relationship with the Tsar and Tsarina.</span></p><p>As enthralled as the Romanovs were, the Russian people were not, and soon pinned every calamity on Rasputin’s scheming — and it was largely justified. Rasputin had no idea how to run a country and the advise he gave to the Romanovs was dutifully followed as if it were religious instructions, which usually ended in disaster.</p><p>It wasn’t long before rumors were published in the press that Rasputin was the Tsarina’s lover and that he was bewitching the Romanovs with some form of dark magic.</p><p>Soon, the Tsar’s nephew-by-marriage, Prince Felix Yusupov, came to the conclusion that only Rasputin’s death would end his control of the Romanovs and restore the legitimacy of the Russian monarchy, which was quickly being destroyed by Rasputin’s actions.</p><p>Conspiring with other prominent monarchists — including the Tsar’s cousin, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, and Vladimir Purishkevich, a deputy in the Duma, Russia’s powerless legislative body — Yusupov set out to kill Rasputin and save the Russian monarchy from collapse.</p><h2>The Assassination Of Grigori Rasputin</h2><p>The principal assassins of Grigori Rasputin: Prince Felix Yusupov, Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich, and deputy of the Duma Vladimir Purishkevich.</p><p>In a memoir written many years after the fact, Yusopov provides a riveting first-hand account of the protracted assassination of Rasputin at his estate in St. Petersberg. </p><p>Having arranged to meet together for pastries and wine at his estate, Yusupov picked up Rasputin from his home and brought him to his palace. </p><p>To justify eating in the cellar, which had been soundproofed for the occasion, his hidden co-conspirators played records in a closed-off room on the main floor to convince Rasputin that Yusupov’s wife was hosting a small party.</p><p>This ruse worked, and the two went down to a furnished cellar to eat, drink, and converse about politics. </p><p>Yusupov offered Rasputin pastries and soon Rasputin began gorging himself on cakes that had been laced with cyanide, chosen specifically because they were known to be Rasputin’s favorite so were the most likely to be eaten by him.</p><p><span>Wikimedia Commons</span><span>The cellar of Felix Yusupov’s estate on Moika, in St. Petersburg, Russia, where the murder of Rasputin began.</span></p><p>Worried that the cyanide, which typically kills almost instantly, didn’t seem to be working, Yusupov invited Rasputin to have a glass of Madiera, pouring the wine into one of several glasses that had also been laced with cyanide. </p><p>Rasputin declined the glass at first, but Rasputin’s gluttony for wine quickly won out and he drank several glasses of wine from poisoned glasses. </p><p>One of Yusupov co-conspirators, a doctor, had prepared each dose of cyanide very carefully to ensure that every one was strong enough to kill not just one but several men.</p><p>Yusupov began to panic as Rasputin appeared to consume enough cyanide to kill scores of men while.

Rasputin stood up as well and appeared to admire the furnishing that Yusupov had brought down into the cellar. </p><p>Seeing Yusupov stare at a crystal crucifix on the wall, Rasputin commented on the cross, then turned away to look at an ornate cabinet on the other side of the room. </p><p>Yusupov told Rasputin, “You’d far better look at the crucifix and say a prayer.”</p><p>At this, Rasputin turned to Yusupov for several tense moments of silence.</p><p>“He came quite close to me and looked me full in the face,” Yusupov recalled. “It was as though he had at last read something in my eyes, something he had not expected to find. I realized that the hour had come. ‘O Lord,’ I prayed, ‘give me the strength to finish it.'”</p><p>Yusupov pulled out the revolver and firing one shot, hitting Rasputin in the chest. Rasputin cried out and collapsed onto the floor, where he laid in a growing pool of blood but did not move.</p><p>Alerted by the gunshot, Yusupov’s co-conspirators rushed downstairs. The doctor checked for Rasputin’s pulse and found none, confirming that Rasputin was dead, shot close enough to his heart to be immediately fatal.</p><h2>The Rise and Re-Assassination Of Rasputin</h2><p><span>Wikimedia Commons</span><span>The courtyard at the Moika embankment of Yusupov’s estate, where Vladimir Purishkevich shot Rasputin to death after earlier attempts failed to kill him.</span></p><p>The conspirators quickly set about establishing their cover story and separated into two groups, with Yusupov staying at Moika with the Duma deputy, Purishkevich. </p><p>Before long, however, Yusupov started feeling uneasy.

Rasputin’s death was being openly celebrated in the press, violating the emergency censorship restrictions barring mention of the murder, and publicly celebrated in the streets.</p><p>“The country was with us, full of confidence in the future,” Yusupov wrote, “The papers published enthusiastic articles, in which they claimed that Rasputin’s death meant the defeat of the powers of evil and held out golden hopes for the future.”</p><p>The Tsarina knew that Yusupov, Pavlovich, and Purishkevich had killed Rasputin — even before Rasputin’s body was found, confirming that he was actually dead — but she couldn’t prove it. With their connections to the Imperial family, the Tsarina’s suspicions weren’t enough to prosecute the men. All the Tsarina could do was convince the Tsar to exile the Yusupov and Pavlovich from St. Petersberg.</p><p><span>Wikimedia Commons</span><span>Students and soldiers fighting with police in the streets of St. Petersberg in March 1917, three months after Rasputin’s death.</span></p><p>Yusupov soon grew disillusioned, however, when the restoration that Rasputin’s death was supposed to inspire never materialized. </p><p>“For many years,” He realized, “Rasputin had by his intrigues demoralized the better elements in the Government, and had sown skepticism and distrust in the hearts of the people. Nobody wanted to take a decision, for nobody believed that any decision would be of any use.”</p><p>Without Rasputin to blame for the mismanagement and failures of the Russian state, the public could only blame the one person who was ultimately responsible for their suffering: Tsar Nicholas II. </p><p>When the Russian people finally rose up in March 1917, it would not be in patriotic defense of the Tsar, as Yusupov has anticipated. Instead, it was to reject the very idea that there should be a Tsar at all. </p><p><em>After reading about Grigori Rasputin’s death, read about Rasputin’s daughter, Maria Rapsutin, who became a dancer and a lion tamer in the Untied States.
